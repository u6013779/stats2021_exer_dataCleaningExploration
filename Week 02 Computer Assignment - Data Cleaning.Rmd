# Data cleaning

## Package management in R

```{r}
# keep a list of the packages used in this script
packages <- c("tidyverse","rio","jmv")
```

This next code block has eval=FALSE because you don't want to run it when knitting the file. Installing packages when knitting an R notebook can be problematic.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# check each of the packages in the list and install them if they're not installed already
for (i in packages){
  if(! i %in% installed.packages()){
    install.packages(i,dependencies = TRUE)
  }
  # show each package that is checked
  print(i)
}
```

```{r}
# load each package into memory so it can be used in the script
for (i in packages){
  library(i,character.only=TRUE)
  # show each package that is loaded
  print(i)
}
```

A note about working with packages and functions in R:
When installing packages you may see notifications that SomePackage::function() masks OtherPackage::function().
What that means is that two different packages used the same function name. The functions may or may not do the same thing, but for whatever reason the pogrammers of each package happened to choose the same name for a function in their respective package. The last package installed will be the version of that function that will be used if only the function name is used in your R code. The SomePackage::function() notation with the colons in it means to use the function named function() from the package named SomePackage. I think I have decided when I write R code that I will always try to stick to that notation. That way it's very clear which package a desired function comes from and there will be no problems with masking if different packages used the same function name.

## Open the dataset

The rio package works for importing several different types of data files. We're going to use it in this class. There are other packages which can be used to open datasets in R. You can see several options by clicking on the Import Dataset menu under the Environment tab in RStudio. (For a csv file like we have this week we'd use either From Text(base) or From Text (readr). Try it out to see the menu dialog.)
```{r}
# import the Week1.csv dataset into RStudio

# Using the file.choose() command allows you to select a file to import from another folder.
# dataset <- rio::import(file.choose())

# This command will allow us to import the csv file included in our project folder.
dataset <- rio::import("Week1.csv")
```

## Examine the dataset

You can uncomment the code below to try different ways to examine the dataset in RStudio. (Remove the # sign from one line at a time.)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
 #The View() command opens a data tab in RStudio. Notice the eval=FALSE option is set for this block.
#Don't evaluate blocks which use the View() command when knitting a file. It could be problematic.
View(dataset)
```

```{r}
#These commands are all different ways to examine the dataset in R.
#You can uncomment each row and run the code block to try each one out.
dplyr::glimpse(dataset) #dplyr is part of the Tidyverse packages
str(dataset)
```

## Examine the data using the jmv package descriptives

```{r}
# get descriptive statistics using jmv package
jmv::descriptives(dataset, vars = vars(nominal,ordinal),freq=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# get descriptive statistics using jmv package
jmv::descriptives(dataset, vars = vars(interval,ratio),freq=FALSE)
```

## Convert factors

Notice that the jmv::descriptives() function doesn't tell us the data type for each variable like the dplyr::glimpse() function.

The rio package (or readr package in RStudio) doesn't automatically convert columns with strings to factors. We need to convert the nominal and ordinal variables to factors and set the order of the levels for the ordinal variable. (R puts factor levels in alphabetical order if an order is not specified.) If you run dplyr::glimpse() again after you execute the following code block, you'll see the class has changed for nominal and ordinal. 

```{r}
# https://suzan.rbind.io/2018/02/dplyr-tutorial-2/#working-with-discrete-columns
dataset <- dataset %>% mutate(nominal = as.factor(nominal))
levels(dataset$nominal)
dataset <- dataset %>% mutate(ordinal = as.factor(ordinal))
levels(dataset$ordinal)
# These could have been done on a single line.
# dataset <- dataset %>% mutate_at(vars(nominal, ordinal), factor)

# Correct order can be specified for ordinal factors.
dataset <- dataset %>% mutate(ordinal = recode_factor(ordinal,"first"="first","second"="second","third"="third","fourth"="fourth",.ordered=TRUE))
levels(dataset$ordinal)
```

## Plots

### jmv::descriptives() function

Jamovi can generate the plots commonly used to examine categorical (nominal, ordinal) and continuous (interval, ratio) variables.

```{r}
# get descriptive statistics using jmv package
jmv::descriptives(dataset, vars = vars(nominal,ordinal),freq=TRUE,bar=TRUE)
```

```{r}
# get plots for continuous variables using jmv package
jmv::descriptives(dataset, vars = vars(interval,ratio),freq=FALSE, hist=TRUE, box=TRUE)
```

### ggplot2::ggplot() function

Plots can also be used to explore your data while data cleaning. While the dfSummary function provides a quick look at variables, sometimes you may want to run specific plots for different purposes. The ggplot2 package is a Tidyverse package whith many types of plots. Run the following code blocks to see examples of plots for each variable type. (There are also many others.)

```{r}
ggplot(data=dataset, aes(x=nominal)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="count")
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=dataset, aes(x=ordinal)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = (..count..)/sum(..count..)))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=dataset, aes(x= "", y = interval)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=dataset, aes(x=ratio)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .2)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=dataset, aes(x=interval, y=ratio)) + 
  geom_point()
```

### ggplot2::qplot() function

The ggplot2 function qplot() is a quick way to make plots. Run the following block of code to create plots for all the variables using qplot().

```{r}
qplot(dataset$nominal)
qplot(dataset$ordinal)
qplot(dataset$interval)
qplot(dataset$ratio)
qplot(dataset$nominal,dataset$ratio)
```
